## Key Features

 - Japanese theme: The story of our characters is developed in an urban environment in Japan, focused in the region of Otaru. Otaru is known for its prosperous cities and work opportunities, but inequality among people is always present; suburbs and worker districts are all around each city.

 - Randomly generated battles: While the character walks and explores the city, they may have to face some imminent enemies and threats. Although there will be some already predefined battles to build the storyline, there will also take place other extra fights to gain resources and prepare yourself to fight the actual bosses. They will appear randomly but with some conditioning factors such as distance traveled or time passed. To make sure that it is not a nuisance or entanglement to continue the with game.

 - Party members management: There will take place 4 different party members, each one with their own character, abilities and appearance. The player will be allowed to change them at any moment during the gameplay, due to the fact that some actions will only be allowed with an specific party member. The battle will also be based on the party members, attacking and defending themselves, each turn a different one.

 - Turn-based Combat: the player will face different enemies in battles developed in turns, each player or enemy teams will have one opportunity to attack or defend per turn.

 - Exploration: the player should investigate into each area and dungeon to search for special and unique objects in order to advance in the story.

 - Quests & Progression: the player will have different challenges to complete in order to upgrade different items. The main quests are about collecting the keys mentioned in the storyline and reward the player with a new party member.

 - Social Interaction: cooperation between party members and what other non-playable characters (NPC) explain is important to know the plot and identify the path to solve the main conflict of the game.
