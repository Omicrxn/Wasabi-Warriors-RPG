	<line left-speaker="Kenzo" right-speaker="None" value="I do..."></line>
	<line left-speaker="Erika" right-speaker="None" value="I know I you will be a good successor and not let my restaurants die without my recipe."></line>

	<line left-speaker="Erika" right-speaker="None" value="He can't. I made sure nobody could open it by force without destroying what's inside. He needs the three keys to open it."></line>

	<line left-speaker="Erika" right-speaker="None" value="Two of them were given to my other two head chefs or my other two restaurants. Takada already suspects it, I'm sure, but I trust them not to give in easily."></line>

	<line left-speaker="None" right-speaker="None" value="You received a vault key!"></line>

	<line left-speaker="Erika" right-speaker="None" value="I'm proud of you Kenzo. Now I can finally rest... goodbye."></line>
	<line left-speaker="Maki" right-speaker="None" value="Woof..."></line>
